# Challenge:

	-Bob has a dog (a bull terrier) named "Shimi". Bob really loves his dog.
	-Alice is a fan of MÃ©canique. She has two vintage cars and often likes to parade around with her ancestral objects.
	-Your mission will be to obtain Alice's or Bob's password

*For this challenge I used Visual Studio Code and Webhook.site (Webhook.site -a platform for testing webhooks).*
